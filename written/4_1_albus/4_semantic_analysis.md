## Semantic Analysis

The semantic analysis phase plays a crucial role in the interpretation process, as it ensures the code is not just syntactically correct, but also logically and contextually correct.

For instance, the following statement is syntactically correct.

```
let x: int = "Hello, World!";
```

However, the types are not compatible, as you cannot assign a string value to a variable with an integer type annotation.

The semantic analysis stage ensures that cases like this are raised before the interpreter begins traversing and executing the AST.
