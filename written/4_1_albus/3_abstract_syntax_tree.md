## Abstract Syntax Tree

After completing the lexer, the next step in building an interpreter is constructing the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). An AST is a tree-like data structure that represents the source code in a way that is easy to traverse and  manipulate.

It abstracts away the raw tokens and syntax and instead creates a more meaningful representation of your program with more expressive components such as statements and declarations.

Let's look at an example. Below is a simple variable declaration.

```
let x = 42;
```

The generated AST statement structure may look like this:

```
VariableDeclaration
  |- Identifier: x
  |- Literal: 42
```

This representation strips away irrelevant syntax such as the equals sign and semicolon, keeping only the meaningful components of the expression. The result is a concise, abstract structure that captures the essence of the variable declaration.

With this simplified structure, the interpreter can easily work with the core components of the declaration - namely, the variable identifier and the assigned value - without dealing with extraneous symbols.

Each expression in the AST will typically be represented by a class or struct, depending on the programming language or design preferences. Let's start by defining a literal expression class for our language. A literal expression is something that represents a fixed value in our code such as a string or number.

```
public class LiteralExpression {
    public readonly object Value;

    public LiteralExpression(object value) {
        Value = value;
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return Value.ToString() ?? "null";
    }
}
```

We also provide a `ToString` implementation for debugging purposes.

The literal expression constructor takes in a value of type `object` as it could be a multitude of types, such as a char literal or a numeric literal.

We are also going to create a base class that serves as a parent for all types of expressions in our language. The reason we are structuring our classes this way is to allow a single list to be able to hold different types of derived expressions. This makes it much easier to manage the statements and expressions in our parser.

Rather than returning a list of expressions directly, we are going to wrap it inside of a class which will represent our program as a single cohesive entity. This code is much more flexible this way as if we wanted to include additional information from the parser in the future - such as metadata or debugging details - we can simply add new properties to the `Ast` class without disrupting existing code in the parser.

```
public abstract class Expression {}

public class Ast {
    public List<Expression> Body = [];
}
```

The parser will follow a similar structure to the lexer, consisting of a current index variable that tracks the position of the current token, a list of tokens to iterate through, and an AST object that will be constructed and returned once parsing is complete.

```
public class Parser {
    public readonly List<Token> Tokens;
    public int Current;
    public readonly Ast Ast = new();

    public Parser(List<Token> tokens) {
        Tokens = tokens;
    }

    public Ast ParseAst() {
        // ...

        return Ast;
    }
}
```

In our parser, each expression will have a dedicated method to parse and return its corresponding type of expression. For instance, `ParseVariableDeclaration`, and `ParseLiteral`, etc.

We can add the following code in our main method for the parser.

```
var parser = new Parser(tokens);
var ast = parser.ParseAst();
if (parser.HasError) {
    return;
}

foreach (var expr in ast.Body) {
    Console.WriteLine($"Expr: {expr}");
}
```

The method below demonstrates how we parse primary expressions - the most basic building block of expressions and statements. Primary expressions include literals such as strings, integers, characters, and booleans. They are what you would call 'leaf nodes' as they are at the bottom of the AST and cannot be decomposed further.

We simply check the token type, parse it into the appropriate C# data type, and return a new literal expression with the value of the token.

```
private Expression ParsePrimary() {
    var expr = Tokens[Current];

    if (expr.Type is TokenType.String) {
        return new LiteralExpression(expr.Lexeme);
    }
    else if (expr.Type is TokenType.Integer) {
        return new LiteralExpression(int.Parse(expr.Lexeme));
    }
    else if (expr.Type is TokenType.Char) {
        return new LiteralExpression(char.Parse(expr.Lexeme));
    }
    else if (expr.Type is TokenType.False or TokenType.True) {
        return new LiteralExpression(bool.Parse(expr.Lexeme));
    }
    else if (expr.Type is TokenType.Identifier) {
        return new LiteralExpression(expr.Lexeme);
    }
    else {
        return new BadExpression(expr.Lexeme);
    }
}
```

The above code is a common pattern you may see in programming where a chain of `if-else` statements each return a value. However, this pattern can be simplified and made more declarative using a `switch` expression, as shown below. This generally makes the code look a little more expressive and is easier to extend. 

I would argue that pattern matching is one of the best features that modern programming offers as it aligns closely with how we naturally process language. Allowing code to express logic in ways that resemble the structure of everyday language reduces the complexity of traditional syntax and reads much easier.

We also introduce a `BadExpression` which will be returned if the parser encounters an error at any point.

```
return expr.Type switch {
    TokenType.String => new LiteralExpression(expr.Lexeme),
    TokenType.Integer => new LiteralExpression(int.Parse(expr.Lexeme)),
    TokenType.Char => new LiteralExpression(char.Parse(expr.Lexeme)),
    TokenType.True or TokenType.False => new LiteralExpression(bool.Parse(expr.Lexeme)),
    TokenType.Identifier => new LiteralExpression(expr.Lexeme),
    _ => new BadExpression(expr.Lexeme)
};
```

Since the primary expression is not the only expression our parser will construct, we define a `ParseExpression` method which will decide which expression it will attempt to parse. For now, it will just call the primary expression method.

```
private Expression ParseExpression() {
    return ParsePrimary();
}
```

Our main parser method will be updated with the following code.

```
while (!IsLastToken() && Tokens[Current].Type is not TokenType.Eof) {
    var expr = ParseExpression();
    Ast.Body.Add(expr);

    if (expr is BadExpression) {
        return Ast;
    }

    Current++;
}

return Ast;
```

We loop until we encounter the end-of-file token, in which case the program will return the Ast parsed thus far. After each iteration, we check if the expression parsed is 'bad' and if so we terminate the parsing early.

We also make use of the following helper method to ensure that we do not attempt to access a token outside the bounds of the token list.

```
private bool IsLastToken() {
    return Current >= Tokens.Count;
}
```

<br/>

Next, we're going to parse the first statement in our language: the variable declaration. 

In Albus, variables are declared using the 'let' keyword, followed by an identifier, an equals sign to assign a value, and finally, the value itself. The statement ends with a semicolon. Hereâ€™s an example of a variable declaration in Albus:

```
let x = 10;
```

We will start by creating a new method for parsing variable declarations.

```
private Expression ParseVariableDeclaration() {
    // this statement will be replaced later as we know it is already a 'let' token
    if (!Expect(TokenType.Let)) {
        return new BadExpression();
    }

    // ...
}
```

We are again going to employ another helper method that will check the type of the current token. This method offers a graceful way to enforce the syntax of our language and alert the programmer of any syntactical errors. We will call this method `Expect` as we are expecting a token with a particular type to appear at that point.

Before accessing the current token, we check if we are currently within the bounds of the token list. If so, we perform the comparison, otherwise we return the error (false). If it is a match, we increment `Current` as we no longer need this token as it is there to simply enforce the syntax of our language. We are also going to pass in a string to be displayed in the expected error output.

```
private bool Expect(TokenType type, String value) {
    if (IsLastToken() || Tokens[Current].Type != type) {
        return ParseError($"expected {value}");
    }

    Current++;
    return true;
}
```

Now we are going to implement the `ParseError` method to provide a nice way of handling parser errors.

The method will retrieve the current token, or the previous token if the parser is at the end of the token list. It will then output the error message along with the line it occurred on.

```
private bool ParseError(string message) {
    HasError = true;

    var currentToken = Tokens[IsLastToken() ? Current - 1 : Current];
    Console.WriteLine($"parsing error: {message} on line {currentToken.Line}");

    return false;
}
```

To track any errors that have occurred in the parser, we introduce the following flag. The flag is public as we will check its state from outside the parser once the parsing has terminated.

```
public bool HasError { get; private set; }
```

Currently, to report an error, we would have to call the `ParseError` method with an appropriate message and then return a bad expression. A given error scenario may look something like this:

```
if (errorHasOccurred) {
    ParseError("Error has occurred");
    return new BadExpression();
}
```

Since this is going to be quite a common pattern in our code, we can abstract away the `ParseError` method into a new method that will return an expression while also taking in a error message and calling `ParseError` for us.

This will allow us to transform the snippet above into the following.

```
if (errorHasOccurred) {
    return ExpressionError("Error has occurred");
}
```

This is much cleaner, easier to read, and removes the overall amount of code we are writing, while still keeping the robust error handling functionality.

The implementation for this method is as follows.

```
private BadExpression ExpressionError(string? message = null) {
    if (message is not null) {
        ParseError(message);
    }

    HasError = true;
    return new BadExpression();
}
```

We pass in the message as normal, however we make it nullable and provide a default parameter. The reason for this is because an error may have already been reported but we still want to use this method to return an error without raising another message in the output.

Take the following snippet as an example.

```
if (!Expect(TokenType.SingleEquals, "=")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}
```

Assume the `Expect` method returns false. An error message will be outputted for this. We then should not have to provide `ExpressionError` with an error message as it has already been handled.

<br/>

Lets return to parsing the variable declaration. We can update the snippet to call our new error reporting method instead of returning a new bad expression instance directly.

```
private Expression ParseVariableDeclaration() {
    Current++; // we already know it is a 'Let' token, so we simply advance past it

    var identifier = Tokens[Current].Lexeme;
    if (!Expect(TokenType.Identifier, "identifier after 'let'")) {
        return ExpressionError();
    }

    return new BadExpression(); // temporary return
}
```

To test the error reporting, lets run the program with the input source below:

```
let
```

This should raise a parser error telling the user that an identifier was expected after the let.

```
parsing error: expected identifier after 'let' on line 1
```

As expected, the parser recognises that the token found after the 'let' was not the token expected when parsing a variable declaration. Now lets implement the rest of the variable parsing logic.

After the identifier has been advanced past, we expect to find a single equals symbol.

```
if (!Expect(TokenType.SingleEquals, "'=' after identifier")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}
```

Next, we parse the actual expression that the variable has been assigned to.

```
var value = ParseExpression();
if (HasError) {
    return ExpressionError("expected expression in variable declaration");
}
```

We perform a check on the `HasError` flag as something could have gone wrong in the `ParseExpression` method. Specifically when we are parsing a primary expression and the expression is not a valid primary expression.

For instance, the following input:

```
let x = ;;
```

Will result in the following error:

```
parsing error: expected expression in variable declaration on line 1
```

Finally, we ensure the declaration ends with a semicolon and return a new instance of a variable declaration.

```
if (!Expect(TokenType.SemiColon, "';' after expression")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}

Current--; // we decrement this as it will be incremented anyway in the main while loop
return new VariableDeclaration(identifier, value);
```

To ensure that the parser attempts to parse the correct statement we need to create a method that directs the parsing logic based on the type of the token currently being examined. This method acts as a 'router', determining how to handle each token it encounters.

If it finds a `Let` token, we attempt to parse a variable declaration, which is currently the only valid statement in our language. There will be others, but for now, it will attempt to parse an expression if any other tokens are encountered.

The top level method `ParseAst` will now call `ParseStatement` instead of `ParseExpression` in the while loop.

To implement this logic, we modify the top-level parsing method to call a new method, ParseStatement, in its while loop. This ensures that the parser correctly delegates token handling to the appropriate method. The reason we are choosing to implement a routing method like this is because it is easily extendible and gives a clear overview of which tokens map to what statements and expressions.

```
private Expression ParseStatement() {
    return Tokens[Current].Type switch {
        TokenType.Let => ParseVariableDeclaration(),
        _ => ParseExpression()
    };
}
```

Now, lets try out our parser with the following input:

```
let x = "Hello, World!";
```

This results in the following expression;

```
Expr: x = "Hello, World!"
```

We are now going to revisit the concept of precedence, which you may recall from the expression evaluator section. The only difference this time is that rather than creating the expressions and then evaluating them, we are just creating them. The evaluation will be done by the interpreter rather than the parser. 

We'll modify our parser by introducing the `ParseTerm` method for handling binary expressions. This method will handle additive operators such as plus and minus as they of the same precedence level.

Hopefully you can recognise some of the code from the method below. We attempt to parse a number first, then continue to parse primary expressions as long as the current operator is a plus or minus. Finally, we return the generated binary expression.

```
private Expression ParseTerm() {
    var left = ParsePrimary();

    while (Match(TokenType.Plus) || Match(TokenType.Minus)) {
        Token op = Tokens[Current++];
        var right = ParsePrimary();
        left = new BinaryExpression(left, op, right);
    }

    return left;
}
```

Similarly, the implementation for multiplicative expressions is the same except we check for the star and slash tokens.

```
private Expression ParseFactor() {
    var left = ParsePrimary();

    while (Match(TokenType.Star) || Match(TokenType.Slash) || Match(TokenType.Modulo)) {
        Token op = Tokens[Current++];
        var right = ParsePrimary();
        left = new BinaryExpression(left, op, right);
    }

    return left;
}
```

We can also update the `ToString` implementation for our binary expression and add parentheses around the expression to show us the levels of precedence.

```
public override string ToString() {
    return $"({Left} {Operator.Lexeme} {Right})";
}
```

Let's test the precedence with the following expression.

```
let x = 2 + 4 - 4 * 32 + 1 * 2;
```

Outputs the following.

```
Expr: x = (((2 + 4) - (4 * 32)) + (1 * 2))
```

As you can see, the brackets show us the actual precedence of the expressions, with the multiplicative expressions being grouped separately.

Now we want our parser to recognise logical expressions involving `and` and `or` tokens. These are slightly simpler to implement as they involve checking the one token type. In boolean logic, logical `and` takes precedence over logical `or`, meaning that the method parsing `or` expressions will call the method parsing `and` expressions to enforce this precedence.

Here is the implementation for the parsing logical `and` expressions.

```
private Expression ParseLogicalAnd() {
    var left = ParseTerm();

    while (Match(TokenType.And)) {
        Token op = Tokens[Current++];
        var right = ParseTerm();
        left = new BinaryExpression(left, op, right);
    }

    return left;
}
```

Similarly, for logical `or` expressions, the method calls `ParseLogicalAnd` to ensure `and` expressions are evaluated first.

```
private Expression ParseLogicalOr() {
    var left = ParseLogicalAnd();

    while (Match(TokenType.Or)) {
        Token op = Tokens[Current++];
        var right = ParseLogicalAnd();
        left = new BinaryExpression(left, op, right);
    }

    return left;
}
```

In Boolean logic, `and` takes precedence over `or`. This is the same precedence we expect in most programming languages, including those derived from C++, which in turn, has its roots in mathematical logic. For instance, consider the following expressions:

```
let x = 2 == 2 and true;
```

You would expect this to be parsed as:

```
Expr: x = ((2 == 2) and True)
```

This makes sense logically and aligns with how most programming languages interpret such expressions. If we were to incorrectly place logical `and` precedence over equality, we would end up with the following:

```
Expr: x = (2 == (2 and True))
```

The first expression is a lot more intuitive and meaningful.

Next, we need to implement parsing for equality expressions, such as equality and inequality operators.

```
private Expression ParseEquality() {
    var left = ParseComparison();

    while (Match(TokenType.DoubleEquals) || Match(TokenType.NotEquals)) {
        Token op = Tokens[Current++];
        var right = ParseComparison();
        left = new BinaryExpression(left, op, right);
    }

    return left;
}
```

Can you see the pattern in all of these methods? Once you can visualise and comprehend the recursive nature of the methods, it starts to all fits together.

The next type of binary expression we will parse is the comparison expression. This involves the four greater/less than operators and will take precedence over equality expressions.

```
private Expression ParseComparison() {
    var left = ParseTerm();

    while (Match(TokenType.GreaterThan) || Match(TokenType.LessThan) || 
            Match(TokenType.GreaterThanEquals) || Match(TokenType.LessThanEquals)) {
        Token op = Tokens[Current++];
        var right = ParseTerm();
        left = new BinaryExpression(left, op, right);
    }

    return left;
}
```

Now that we have implemented the necessary parsing methods, we can test them using an example expression:

```
let x = 2 > 4 + 1 or 2 == 4 and 2 != 2;
```

With the precedence rules in place, this expression is parsed correctly as follows:

```
Expr: x = ((2 > (4 + 1)) or ((2 == 4) and (2 != 2)))
```

The next part of our parse we are going to construct will handle the conditional if statements in our code. The syntax for these are as follows.

```
if condition then
 // ...
endif
```

They can also have additional branches with:

```
if condition then
 // ...
elseif condition then
  // ...
else then
  // ...
endif
```

Like the variable declaration, we are going to create a separate method to handle the parsing of the if statement.

We add another pattern into the `ParseStatement` method for the parser to attempt to parse the conditional.

```
TokenType.If => ParseIfStatement(),
```

Additionally, we need to create a class to represent an if statement expression. Firstly, lets break down the important parts of an if statement.

```
if condition then
    // body
endif
```

The key components of an `if` statement are the condition and the body. In its simplest form, the statement consists of a condition followed by a body of code that executes if the condition evaluates to true. However, they can also be extended with one or more `else if` branches, each with its own condition and associated body of code. While each branch has a separate condition, it is part of the original if statement and should be parsed within the same structure.

The condition part can be represented with an `Expression`, which will evaluate to a Boolean. The body can be represented as a list of `Expression` objects. Finally, the alternate branch can be represented as another nested if statement inside the class. Note that this nested statement should be nullable as an additional branch is always optional.


```
public class IfStatement : Expression {
    public readonly Expression Condition;  // The condition (expression) of the if statement
    public readonly List<Expression> Body;  // The body (list of expressions) of the if statement
    public readonly IfStatement? Alternate;  // The optional 'else if' or 'else' part (nested IfStatement)

    public IfStatement(Expression condition, List<Expression> body, IfStatement? alternate) {
        Condition = condition;
        Body = body;
        Alternate = alternate;
    }
}
```

Now lets implement it.

We start by advancing past the `if` token.

```
private Expression ParseIfStatement() {
    Current++;

    // ...
}
```

Next, we parse an expression for the condition and perform an error check in case the expression is invalid.

```
var condition = ParseExpression();
if (HasError) {
    return ExpressionError("invalid condition in if statement");
}
```

Next, we enforce the `then` syntactic rule.

```
if (!Expect(TokenType.Then, "'then' after if statement condition")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}
```

Next, to parse the body of the if statement, we loop continuously until we encounter an `endif` token, while adding each statement into a list. Note that we also have to manually increment the pointer as it is not being fed through the main parser loop.

```
var body = new List<Expression>();
while (!IsLastToken() && Tokens[Current].Type is not TokenType.Endif) {
    var statement = ParseStatement();
    Current++;

    body.Add(statement);
}
```

Finally, once the while loop terminates, we return a new if expression with the condition and body.

```
return new IfStatement(condition, body, null);
```

Currently, we are passing in `null` for the if statement which means that we only currently support single-if statements. To add additional condition branching to the expression, we need to make a few changes to our existing code. 

We will start by renaming `body` variable to `ifBody` as we are going to have a separate body for else and this makes what it is it a lot clearer.

```
var ifBody = new List<Expression>();
```

We also need to update the while condition to look for not just the `Endif` token, but the alternative branching tokens, such as `ElseIf`.

```
!IsLastToken() && CurrentToken().Type is not (TokenType.Endif or TokenType.Elseif or TokenType.Else)
```

After the loop ends, it means we have either encountered an `Endif`, `ElseIf`, or `Else` token (or the parser has reached the end of the program). Now, we parse the else-if branch the exact same way as the `if` branch, the only difference being that it is an alternate path.

We start by defining an `IfStatement` to hold the data about the potential else-if branch. We set it to null as you are able to have a singular if statement with no additional branches.

```
IfStatement? alternate = null;
```

Since the parsing is identical, we can recursively call the method that parses an if statement. This will handle the parsing for us, all we have to do is check the parser is not at the end of the program and the current token is the start of an else-if branch.

```
if (!IsLastToken()) {
    if (Match(TokenType.Elseif)) {
        alternate = (IfStatement)ParseIfStatement();
    } 
}
```

We can now return a new if statement, passing in the alternate and optional if-else branch into the expression.

```
return new IfStatement(condition, ifBody, alternate);
```

Parsing the `else` is slightly more complex as we are unable to use the recursion method due to the loop that parses the else body requiring a different condition. However, it is mostly stuff we have already written.

We start by checking if the current token is an `Else` token, incrementing past it if that is true. Then, we enforce the syntax of a `Then` appearing after the `Else` keyword.

We define another list to hold all of the expressions that will make up the body of the else statement. Then, similarly to the loop near the beginning of the method, we parse each statement inside the body and add to the list.

Finally, we set the alternate to a new `IfStatement` expression and pass the condition in as `null`. We do this because an else has no condition, it only executes if none of the above branches have evaluated to true. The alternate branch is also passed in as `null` as an else branch marks the end of the if statement.

```
else if (Match(TokenType.Else)) {
    Current++;

    if (!Expect(TokenType.Then, "'then' after if statement condition")) {
        return ExpressionError();
    }

    var elseBody = new List<Expression>();
    while (!IsLastToken() && CurrentToken().Type is not TokenType.Endif) {
        var statement = ParseStatement();
        Current++;

        elseBody.Add(statement);
    }

    alternate = new IfStatement(null, elseBody, null);
}
```

Now that we have completed the if statement parsing, we add a new option in the `ParseStatement` that directs the parser to parse the if statement.

```
TokenType.If => ParseIfStatement(),
```

The next control flow construct we are going to incorporate is the `while` loop. A while loop is much simpler than an if statement as it consists of just a condition and a list of statements.

The expression class for a `while` statement is as follows:

```
public class WhileStatement : Expression {
    public readonly Expression Condition;
    public readonly List<Expression> Body;

    public WhileStatement(Expression condition, List<Expression> body) {
        Condition = condition;
        Body = body;
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        string bodyStr = string.Join("\n", Body.Select(b => "  " + b.ToString()));

        return $"while {Condition} \n{bodyStr} \nend";
    }
}
```

We define two properties: one to represent the condition of the while loop, and one to represent the list of statements inside it.

The implementation for a while loop is much simpler than the if statement as there are no alternate or special types of branches.

```
private Expression ParseWhileStatement() {
        Current++;

        var condition = ParseExpression();
        if (HasError) {
            return ExpressionError("invalid condition in while statement");
        }

        List<Expression> body = [];
        while (!IsLastToken() && !Match(TokenType.End)) {
            var statement = ParseStatement();
            body.Add(statement);

            Current++;
        }

        return new WhileStatement(condition, body);
    }
```

Once again, we advance past the `While` token to begin with. Then we parse the conditional expression and check for any errors during parsing. Next, we loop until we encounter an `End` token. This is because everything inside the while loop up until the `End` token will be considered part of the body.

Finally, we add an additional case in the top parsing method.

```
TokenType.While => ParseWhileStatement(),
```

Now that we have implemented the parsing for while loops, it is probably a good time to introduce the `Next` and `Break` keywords.

The `Next` keyword will allow us to terminate the current iteration of a loop and skip directly to the next one. It behaves exactly like the continue statement in the C programming language, making it useful when certain conditions within the loop should be bypassed without ending the loop entirely.

The model for the Next keyword is extremely simple and does not actually require any fields. The entire class serves as a semantic marker or placeholder, signifying the behavior of skipping the rest of the current iteration.

```
public class NextStatement : Expression {
    public NextStatement() {
        
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return "next";
    }
}
```

As you can probably imagine, he method for parsing a next statement is very basic. We implement it with the following code.

```
private Expression ParseNextStatement() {
    Current++;

    if (!Expect(TokenType.SemiColon, "';' after 'next'")) {
        return ExpressionError();
    }

    Current--;
    return new NextStatement();
}
```

We advance past the `Next` token. We then enforce the semicolon syntax for ending a statement. We also have to decrement the pointer afterwards as it will be advanced when this method returns to the main loop.

The `Break` keyword terminate the execution of the current loop. The model for the break statement is for the most part identical to the `Next` statement model.

```
public class BreakStatement : Expression {
    public BreakStatement() {

    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return "break";
    }
}
```

We parse the break statement in the same way as the next statement.

```
private Expression ParseBreakStatement() {
    Current++;

    if (!Expect(TokenType.SemiColon, "';' after 'break'")) {
        return ExpressionError();
    }

    Current--;
    return new BreakStatement();
}

```

A unary expression is an expression that only has one operand inside of it. For instance, in most languages, the `!` operator is a unary operator used to negate a logical expression.

Because it does not follow the standard pattern of a binary expression, we need to create a new class for unary expressions to hold the operator and operand.

We implement this as follows:

```
public class UnaryExpression : Expression {
    public readonly Expression Left;
    public readonly Token Operator;

    public UnaryExpression(Expression left, Token op) {
        Left = left;
        Operator = op;
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return $"({Operator.Lexeme} {Left})";
    }
}
```

Next, we should determine the precedence level for our unary operators. To make an informed decision, itâ€™s helpful to write examples of these operators in various contexts and analyze how they should interact with other operators. Considering different scenarios allows us to choose the precedence that ensures intuitive and consistent behavior in the language.

Take the following statement.

```
let x = -1 + 2;
```

This statement could be interpreted in two different ways depending on the precedence of the unary operator.

In the case below, the negation is applied to the 1, resulting in the expression evaluating to 1. This behavior is typical, where the unary operators are given a higher precedence over arithmetic operators like plus and minus;

```
let x = (-1) + 2; // 1
```

The alternative way to parse this expression is by assigning a higher precedence to the plus operator. This means that the arithmetic expression will be evaluated first and then the result will be negated.

```
let x = -(1 + 2); // -3
```

Given this, the unary operator needs to have a higher precedence than factors and terms. Therefore, since the `ParseTerm` method calls `ParseFactor`, the next level of precedence show be the unary expression.

The implementation for parsing a unary operator is as follows:

```
private Expression ParseUnary() {
    if (Match(TokenType.Minus) || Match(TokenType.Not)) {
        Token op = Tokens[Current++];
        var operand = ParseUnary();
        return new UnaryExpression(operand, op);
    }

    return ParsePrimary();
}
```
We start by checking for the `Minus` and `Not` tokens. These are currently the only valid unary operators in our language. If none of these tokens are present we simply parse a primary expression as normal.

Next, we save the operator token and attempt to parse another unary expression. This allows us to have nested unary expressions, for instance:

```
let x = not not not true; // amongst more practical uses
```

Finally, we return the new unary expression.

We also update the `ParseFactor` method to call the `ParseUnary` methods instead of `ParsePrimary`.

```
    private Expression ParseFactor() {
        var left = ParseUnary();

        while (Match(TokenType.Star) // ...) {
            var right = ParseUnary();

            // ...
        }

        // ...
    }
```

Now, when we type the following statement, the parser will find the unary `not` operator and attach it to the expression directly after it.

```
let x = not true; // false
```

Next, we will learn how to parse a ternary operator expression. This is a special type of expression that is essentially shorthand for an if-else block.

For instance, the following snippet:

```
let x = condition ? 1 : 0;
```

Is equivalent to the if-else block below. It is just a more concise way of assigning the value.

```
let x;
if (condition) {
    x = 1;
} else {
    x = 0;
}
```

In our language, a ternary expression consists of three distinct components: the condition to be evaluated, the expression to be assigned if the condition is true, and the expression to be assigned if the condition is false.

The class implementation for this is as follows:

```
public class TernaryExpression : Expression {
    public readonly Expression Condition;
    public readonly Expression TrueBranch;
    public readonly Expression FalseBranch;

    public TernaryExpression(Expression condition, Expression trueBranch, Expression falseBranch) {
        Condition = condition;
        TrueBranch = trueBranch;
        FalseBranch = falseBranch;
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return $"{Condition} then {TrueBranch} else {FalseBranch}";
    }
}
```

The ternary operator acts as a high-level condition expression that encompasses other expressions, therefore it should have a very low precedence compared to everything else.

Given this, we can update the `ParseExpression` method to call a new method: `ParseTernary`, which will have a precedence that of just above the logical or parsing method.

We start by parsing the condition that the ternary operator will evaluate. If the next token is not a `Then`, then the expression is not a ternary expression, therefore we simply return the parsed condition.

```
private Expression ParseTernary() {
    var condition = ParseLogicalOr();

    if (Match(TokenType.Then)) {
        // ...
    }

    return condition;
}
```

Now, we first increment past the `Then` token. We then parse the first condition for the true-branch. We then enforce the `Else` token syntax and parse another expression for the false-branch. Lastly, we return a new ternary expression with the condition and branches.

```
Current++;
var trueBranch = ParseExpression();

if (!Expect(TokenType.Else, "'else' after ternary condition")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}

var falseBranch = ParseExpression();
return new TernaryExpression(condition, trueBranch, falseBranch);
```

Since we are calling the `ParseExpression` method for the true and false branches of the ternary, and due to the recursive nature of the parser, we are able to infinitely nest ternary expressions like this:

```
let x = true then 1 
    else true then 1
    else not true then 1 + 1
    else not false or true then 2 * 4 % 1
    else 0;

```

Here, the nested ternary expressions demonstrate the flexibility and expressive power of this construct. However, as this example shows, the readability of such code can suffer when ternary expressions are deeply nested.

We are also going to add a check after each `ParseExpression` to ensure that the errors are properly handled. We will revisit the error handling and debugging mechanisms in a later chapter. For now, we are simply displaying a short, informative message.

```
// ...

var trueBranch = ParseExpression();
if (HasError) {
    return ExpressionError("expected expression in ternary operator");
}

// ...
```

Functions are a cornerstone of programming, allowing us to break down problems into smaller, reusable components. In Albus, functions are defined with a clear and concise syntax. Here's an example of a simple function:

```
def double(n: int): int
    return n * 2;
end
```

This snippet defines a function `double` that takes in a parameter `n`, and returns the value of `n` multiplied by two.

By now you should be quite comfortable with parsing statements and expressions and have some sort of vision for how this could work. Let's analyze each part of the function declaration.

The `def` keyword marks the start of a function declaration and is purely syntactical. This will be followed by the name of the function and a list of parameters enclosed inside brackets. A parameter starts with a name, followed by a colon, and then the type of the parameter.

The example above only has one parameter being passed in, however if there were multiple parameters passed in to the function, each parameter would be separated by a comma, like this:

```
// ... (n1: int, n2: int)
```

Then, the closing parenthesis will be followed by a colon and then the return type of the function, marking the end of our function signature. The rest of the statements after this declaration are all part of the functions body until an `End` token is encountered.

In our function structure, the key components to consider when parsing a declaration are the function name, parameters, return type, and body. These parts (except the body) make up the functions unique signature.

Here is the model for our function declaration based on these components.

```
public class FunctionDeclaration: Expression {
    public readonly string Identifier;
    public readonly List<FunctionParameter> Parameters;
    public readonly Token ReturnType;
    public readonly List<Expression> Body;

    public FunctionDeclaration(string identifier, List<FunctionParameter> parameters, Token returnType, List<Expression> body) {
        Identifier = identifier;
        Parameters = parameters;
        ReturnType = returnType;
        Body = body;
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return $"def {Identifier} ({Parameters}): {ReturnType}\n{Body}";
    }
}
```

We also need a model to represent a function parameter as an object that encapsulates its name and type.

```
public class FunctionParameter : Expression
{
    public readonly string Identifier;
    public readonly Token Type;

    public FunctionParameter(string identifier, Token type)
    {
        Identifier = identifier;
        Type = type;
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return $"{Identifier}: {Type},";
    }
}
```

Since all function definitions start with the `Def` keyword, we can simply look for this occurrence and then continue to parse the rest of the function.

Add the `Def` token to the lexer vocabulary if you haven't already.

```
TokenType.Def   => ParseFunctionDeclaration(),
```

Again, we start by advancing past the initial keyword for this statement.

```
private Expression ParseFunctionDeclaration() {
    Current++;

    // ...
}
```

Next, we parse the name of the function.

```
var identifier = Tokens[Current].Lexeme;
if (!Expect(TokenType.Identifier, "function name after 'def'")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}
```

The next part of our function signature is the list of parameters the function takes in. To begin with, we expect an open parenthesis character.

```
if (!Expect(TokenType.LeftParen, "'(' after function name")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}
```

We define a list to hold the parameters that we are going to parse from this function. Then, we start a while loop that will keep looking for more parameters until it encounters a right parenthesis character. 

```
List<FunctionParameter> parameters = [];
while (!IsLastToken() && !Match(TokenType.RightParen)) {
    // ...
}
```

Next, we first expect to find the name of the parameter. We capture this inside a variable while also advancing the current pointer.

```
var name = Tokens[Current++];

if (IsLastToken()) {
    return ExpressionError("invalid function signature");
}
```

Since we are incrementing the current pointer, we have to check if we are currently at the last token to prevent any out-of-bounds errors.

The next token expected for a function parameter is a colon character which is then followed by the type of the parameter. Once we have the name and type of the parameter, we add it to the list of expressions we defined earlier.

```
if (!Expect(TokenType.Colon, "':' after parameter")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}

var type = Tokens[Current++];
// we don't check out of range here as the next snippet does this in `Match` and `Expect`

parameters.Add(new(name.Lexeme, type));
```

To account for multiple parameters in the function signature, we expect a comma after each type. We also check that the current token is not a right parenthesis as there would be no comma required in a function that takes a singular parameter.

At this point, the parameter list could either end with a right parenthesis or continue with a comma, which is why suggest the two tokens in the error message.

```
if (!Match(TokenType.RightParen) && !Expect(TokenType.Comma, "',' or ')' after parameter")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}
```

The last part of the function signature is the return type. This is simply a colon character followed by a type. We first advance past the right parenthesis from the parameter list.

Similarly to a parameter, we expect a colon and then capture the return type token. We also perform another check to ensure we do not access a token beyond bounds.

```
Current++;
if (!Expect(TokenType.Colon, "':' to specify function return type")) {
    return ExpressionError();
}

if (IsLastToken()) {
    return ExpressionError("expected function return type in signature");
}
var returnType = Tokens[Current++];
```

The last part of our function expression is the actual body of statements itself.

We define a list to hold our statements. Then we continue to loop while the parser does not encounter an `End` token. It will consider everything up until then as part of the function body.

```
var statements = new List<Expression>();
while (!IsLastToken() && !Match(TokenType.End)) {
    var statement = ParseStatement();
    statements.Add(statement);

    Current++;
}
```

If the parser reaches the end of the token list without encountering an End token for the function, an error is reported.

Finally, we return a new function declaration expression containing the components that we have parsed from the signature and the body.

```
if (IsLastToken()) {
    return ExpressionError("function declaration started but missing 'End'");
}

Current++;

return new FunctionDeclaration(identifier, parameters, returnType, statements);
```

To enable the parser to be able to return information, we need to incorporate the `Return` statement. This is a very simple expression as it is simply the word 'return' followed by some expression.

The model for this is as follows.

```
public class ReturnStatement : Expression {
    public readonly Expression Value;

    public ReturnStatement(Expression value) {
        Value = value;
    }

    public override string ToString() {
        return $"return {Value}";
    }
}
```

The implementation for the return statement is also very simple. We advance past the return keyword, then parse the following expression. Finally, we expect a semicolon at the end of the statement and return a new return expression.

```
private Expression ParseReturnStatement() {
    Current++;

    var expression = ParseExpression();
    if (HasError) {
        return ExpressionError("expected expression in return statement");
    }

    if (!Expect(TokenType.SemiColon, "';' after return statement")) {
        return ExpressionError();
    }

    Current--;
    return new ReturnStatement(expression);
}
```

Additionally, we add the following in `ParseStatement`.

```
TokenType.Return   => ParseReturnStatement(), 
```

<br/>

Currently, the parser supports the following major types of statements and expressions:

```
- Variable Declarations
- Function Declarations
- Binary and Unary Expressions
- If Statements
- While Loops
- Ternary Operations
```

At this point, our language has a sufficient range of expressions to allow us to proceed to the next phase of the interpreter: semantic analysis.
