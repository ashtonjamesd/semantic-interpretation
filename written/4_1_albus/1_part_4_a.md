## The Albus Language Interpreter

We’ve now reached the point where, having followed this guide diligently, you're prepared to write your own advanced programming language interpreter. This language, called Albus, is designed to be statically typed, object-oriented, and minimalist, with a syntax influenced by Ruby.

Although it is written in C-Sharp for the purpose of this book, I have plans to rewrite Albus in a more suitable language, such as Rust or Zig (or maybe even C). Maybe I’ll do a book on that in the future - until then, it will have to sorrowfully reside as a sluggish interpreter with no real applicable use.
