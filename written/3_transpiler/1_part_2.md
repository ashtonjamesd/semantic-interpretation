## Part 2 - Transpiler

Transpilers, or source-to-source compilers are a unique and less common type of compiler. Unlike traditional compilers that translate source code into machine code, transpilers convert code written in one language into another high-level language.

In this chapter, we will explore the process of building a transpiler for our own programming language. The objective is to take out custom language and transpile it into C source code.
