## Project Setup

To get started, we need to set up a new C# console application. First, navigate to the folder where you want to create your new project. If needed, create a new folder to keep your work organised.

Open a terminal or code editor in your desired folder and enter the following command to create a new C# console app.

```
dotnet new console
```

A C# project will be generated in your current directory. Enter the following command to run the code and review the output.

```
dotnet run
```

You should see:

```
Hello, World!
```

Now we can begin writing the program.
