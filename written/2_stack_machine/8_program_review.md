## Program Review

That wasnâ€™t too bad, was it? I hope not, because it only gets harder (and more exciting) from here. And there are three more projects to complete. 

To summarise, we learnt about the basics of lexical analysis, control flow, and statement execution. We also learnt about how to effectively handle errors and relay useful information back to the programmer for debugging purposes.

The next project is a bit more involved and the focus will be on more advanced concepts such as an abstract syntax tree and a custom variable registry.
