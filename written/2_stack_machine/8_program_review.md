## Program Review

That wasnâ€™t too bad, was it? I hope not, because it only gets harder (and more exciting) from here.

To summarise, we learnt about the basics of lexical analysis, control flow, and statement execution. We also learnt about how to effectively handle errors and relay useful information back to the programmer for debugging purposes.

Next, we're going to build an advanced language interpreter that builds on the concepts we learned while introducing some new ones.
