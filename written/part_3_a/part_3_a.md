## Language Interpreter

We have now arrived at the stage where, if you have followed the guide thoroughly, you should be prepared to write your own advanced programming language interpreter.

The significance and scale of this endeavour call for a project name, and I’ve decided to name mine Albus, meaning ‘white’ in Latin. Albus will be a statically typed, object-oriented, minimalist programming language and the syntax is inspired by Ruby.

Although it is written in C-Sharp for the purpose of this book, I have plans to rewrite Albus as a language compiler in Rust. Maybe I’ll do a book on that in the future - until then, it will have to sorrowfully reside as a sluggish interpreter with no real applicable use.

Finally, an adequate test for our brand new language interpreter would be to fully implement the stack machine from part 1. This tests quite a lot of the functionality in our program and offers quite a rewarding outcome.
