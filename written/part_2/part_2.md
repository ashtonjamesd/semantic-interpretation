## Bytecode Interpreter

Interpreters play a crucial role in executing source code. While many modern programming languages compile to machine code, some opt for a middle-ground approach and compile into an intermediate representation known as bytecode.

A bytecode interpreter is a program that takes in bytecode and executes each chunk of code, mimicking the behavior of the original source code.

In this chapter, we will delve into the process of building a bytecode interpreter for our own programming language.
