# A note on Language Interpretation

It is important to realise that computers do not “know” anything. They simply do what they are told in a very static, boring way. Because of this, we have to come up with creative methods to work with computers effectively. The complexity of a computer at the CPU level is very impractical to work with and would require a lot of nonessential knowledge of how the computer operates at such a level. To combat this, we created software abstractions that allow us to interact with computers more intuitively. Language interpreters and compilers are examples of such abstractions.
