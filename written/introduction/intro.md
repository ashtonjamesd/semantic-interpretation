# Introduction

Whether you’re near the beginning of your development journey, a seasoned developer with decades of experience, or simply someone intrigued by computer science this book has something to offer. My goal is that you’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of language interpretation, along with a dose of practical knowledge applicable in your own projects.

Throughout this book, you’ll embark on a journey through the development of several interpretation projects. These projects range from a stack-based machine to building a bytecode compiler, and ultimately a fully-featured object-oriented language. 

You’ll gain a deep understanding of what an interpreter is, how they operate, and the practical reasons for undertaking such projects beyond mere technical prowess.
