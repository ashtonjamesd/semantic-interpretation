# Introduction

Whether you’re near the beginning of your development journey, a seasoned developer with decades of experience, or simply someone intrigued by computer science this book has something to offer. My goal is that you’ll walk away with a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of programming language interpretation, along with a touch of practical knowledge applicable in your own projects.

Throughout this book, you’ll embark on a journey through the development of several interpretation projects. These projects range from a mathematical expression evaluator, to building a stack-based machine, and ultimately a fully-featured object-oriented language.

You’ll gain a deep understanding of what an interpreter is, how they operate, and the practical reasons for undertaking such projects beyond mere technical prowess.

The inspiration for this book was the result of reflecting on what an ideal learning resource would look like - one that could enhance my learning, based on hindsight, in the most efficient way possible. What kind of book would have been most effective for me if I were to start learning interpreters from scratch? This book is the result of that reflection, designed to be the comprehensive foundation I wish I had when diving into the world of interpreters. There also aren't many books on programming language design so I thought I would saturate the space.
