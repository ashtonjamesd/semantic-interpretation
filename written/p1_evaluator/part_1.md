## Part 1 - Expression Evaluator

Weâ€™re going to begin at a very basic level and write a simple mathematical expression evaluator. It will support basic additive and multiplicative operations, as well as different number formats. The goal of this project is to take in a mathematical expression and return the evaluated numeric value.

I will be using C-Sharp for this project as it provides a high level of abstraction with a straightforward and user-friendly environment for working with concepts related to interpretation. I suggest you follow in the same language for clarity.
